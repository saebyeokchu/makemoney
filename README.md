# 💸 MakeMoney

**MakeMoney** is an automated economic signal collector and ETF decision assistant.  
It surfs various financial and economic websites, analyzes daily macroeconomic indicators, and generates plain-text summaries that can be used to support ETF investment decisions.

## 🧠 Project Goals

- 📊 **Collect daily economic data** from multiple sources
- 🤖 **Analyze** indicators like inflation, interest rates, commodity prices, etc.
- 📁 **Generate readable reports** to help decide whether to invest in specific ETFs
- 🧱 Designed as a modular foundation for a future AI-based investment assistant

---

## 🔧 Features

- 🌐 Web crawling with Python (e.g., `urllib`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`)
- 📈 Rule-based signal interpretation (e.g., if CPI rises → negative for bonds)
- 🧾 Outputs a simple `.txt` report with summarized insights
- 📦 Clean modular structure for extension (e.g., AI/ML models later)

## 📈 Example Use Case

**Scenario**:  
- Inflation data rises  
- Bond yields spike  
- USD strengthens

**Result**:
```txt
[오늘의 경제 요약]
- 물가 지표 상승 → 채권에 부정적
- 금리 인상 가능성 존재
- ETF 'TIP'(물가연동채권)은 주의 필요

[추천]
- 오늘은 주식형 ETF보다 단기채권 또는 현금 비중 확대가 유리
```

---

## 🧩 Next Steps

- [ ] Add support for more economic sources (e.g., Fed, KDI, Bloomberg)
- [ ] Incorporate AI/ML for pattern recognition and backtesting
- [ ] Add portfolio simulation module

Let me know if you want to include **example ETF names**, **sample sources (e.g., KOSIS, Investing.com, FRED)**, or if you're planning to hook this into a front-end or Telegram bot — I can add sections for that too.
